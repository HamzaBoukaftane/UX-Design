## Redesigning the Polytechnique Montréal Student Website: A Comprehensive Guide

This document outlines the process for proposing a new design for the Polytechnique Montréal student website ([https://dossieretudiant.polymtl.ca/WebEtudiant7/poly.html](https://dossieretudiant.polymtl.ca/WebEtudiant7/poly.html)). This process emphasizes user needs and incorporates valuable feedback to create a more user-friendly and informative website.

**1. Exploratory Phase: Data Gathering**

* **Goals:**
    * Understand the current state of the student website.
    * Identify user needs and pain points.
    * Gather information on competitor websites or similar institutions.
* **Activities:**
    * **Website Audit:** Conduct a thorough review of the existing website, analyzing navigation, content structure, visual design, and user experience (UX).
    * **User Research:** Utilize various methods to gather data about user needs and expectations. This could include:
        * **User Interviews:** Engage with students from various disciplines and academic years to understand their website usage patterns, needs, and frustrations.
        * **Surveys:** Distribute questionnaires to a broader student population to gather quantitative data on website preferences and pain points.
        * **User Analytics (if available):** Analyze existing website traffic data to understand which pages are most visited, user demographics, and potential areas for improvement.
    * **Competitive Analysis:** Examine websites of other universities and educational institutions to identify best practices and potential features to consider.

**2. Analysis Phase**

* **Goals:**
    * Organize and synthesize the gathered data.
    * Identify patterns and trends in user needs and pain points.
    * Define design goals and user personas.
* **Activities:**
    * **Data Analysis:** Analyze the data gathered from user research (interviews, surveys) and website audit.
    * **User Persona Creation:** Develop user personas representing different types of students (e.g., new freshman, graduate student) with their specific needs and goals.
    * **Information Architecture (IA):** Define the optimal structure and organization of content based on user needs and website goals.
    * **Content Inventory:** Analyze existing content and determine if it aligns with user needs. Identify any missing content or redundancy.

**3. Conception Phase: High-Level Prototype with Figma**

* **Goals:**
    * Develop a visual representation of the proposed website redesign.
    * Translate user needs and project goals into a tangible prototype.
    * Facilitate user testing and gather feedback.
* **Activities:**
    * **Wireframing:** Create low-fidelity wireframes to establish the basic layout and structure of the website.
    * **Prototyping:** Develop a high-fidelity prototype in Figma, focusing on key functionalities and visual design elements. Figma allows for user interaction with the prototype, simulating a real-world browsing experience.
    * **Usability Testing:** Conduct usability testing sessions with student participants, using the Figma prototype to assess ease of use, navigation, and overall user experience.

**4. User Testing and Data Analysis**

* **Goals:**
    * Evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed design based on user feedback.
    * Identify areas for improvement and iterate on the design.
* **Activities:**
    * **Recruit Test Participants:** Recruit representative students from different user personas for usability testing.
    * **Testing Sessions:** Conduct moderated testing sessions, observing participants as they interact with the Figma prototype. Encourage them to provide verbal feedback on their experience.
    * **Data Analysis:** Analyze the feedback gathered from user testing. Identify recurring issues and areas for improvement.
    * **Iteration:** Based on user feedback, iterate on the design, refining the prototype and addressing identified problems.

**Deliverables:**

This process will result in several key deliverables:

* **Website Audit Report:** A comprehensive report summarizing the findings of the website audit.
* **User Research Report:** A report outlining the results of user interviews, surveys, and user persona development.
* **Information Architecture (IA) Diagram:** A visual representation of the proposed website's content structure and navigation.
* **Figma Prototype:** A high-fidelity, interactive prototype showcasing the proposed website design.
* **Usability Testing Report:** A report summarizing the findings of user testing sessions and recommendations for improvement.

**Next Steps:**

Following the completion of the user testing phase, the next steps would involve refining the design based on user feedback. This iterative process may involve multiple rounds of user testing and design adjustments. Once finalized, the proposed design can be presented to relevant stakeholders for approval and implementation.
